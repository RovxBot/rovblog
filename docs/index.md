# Welcome to Rov's Tech Blog

## About This Blog

Welcome to my blog. I'm Rov, a Microsoft Cloud DevOps Engineer based in Australia, sharing insights from real-world enterprise environments and home lab experiments.

This blog focuses on practical solutions, best practices, and lessons learned from implementing Microsoft technologies, DevOps practices, and security frameworks in production environments.

Recently I have also started on a solo game dev journy as well, so you will also find some of my creative writing and world building in the creative projects section. Be kind, I have only been doing this for a few months, so it's a bit of a learning curve.
