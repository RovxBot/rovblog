# Welcome to Rov's Tech Blogs!

Welcome to my site! I'm Rov a Micorsoft Cloud DevOps Engineer working in Australia. I have a passion for technology and the ways it can be used in an enterprise enviroment to improve productivity and efficiency.

If a task can be automated then it should be be!

I have a strong background in Microsoft technologies. If it has been developed by Microsoft then I have probably worked with it at some point in my career. I have a strong background in Azure, Office 365, Windows Server, Active Directory, Exchange, SQL Server, SharePoint, PowerShell, and many other Microsoft technologies.

I am one of those wierdos that do this not only as a job but also for fun. I am always looking for new technologies to learn and new ways to improve my skills.

Anyway enough about me, I hope you enjoy my blogs and find them useful. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to reach out to me! I am always happy to help where I can.
