# Welcome to Rov's Tech Blog!

Welcome to my site! I'm Rov, a Microsoft Cloud DevOps Engineer working in Australia. I have a passion for technology and the ways it can be used in an enterprise environment to improve productivity and efficiency.

**If a task can be automated, then it should be!**

I have a strong background in Microsoft technologies. If it has been developed by Microsoft, then I have probably worked with it at some point in my career. I have extensive experience with Azure, Office 365, Windows Server, Active Directory, Exchange, SQL Server, SharePoint, PowerShell, and many other Microsoft technologies.

I am one of those weirdos that do this not only as a job but also for fun. I am always looking for new technologies to learn and new ways to improve my skills.

Anyway, enough about meâ€”I hope you enjoy my blogs and find them useful. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me! I am always happy to help where I can.
