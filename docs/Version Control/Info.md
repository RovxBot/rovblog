Fully Automated Client Onboarding Demo Setup (Azure, GitHub Actions & Microsoft Fabric)
1. Setting Up Base Azure Infrastructure

To isolate each client’s environment, begin by provisioning dedicated Azure resources for the client:

Resource Group: Create a new Azure Resource Group to contain all resources for the client (using Azure PowerShell New-AzResourceGroup or Azure CLI). This groups related resources (Data Factory, Key Vault, etc.) and simplifies management.

Azure Data Factory Instance: Deploy an Azure Data Factory (ADF) instance in the resource group (e.g. with New-AzDataFactoryV2). ADF will handle data ingestion pipelines for the client. Ensure the ADF instance name is unique to the client.

Azure Key Vault: Create an Azure Key Vault for storing secrets (API keys, service principal credentials, etc.). You will later store the client’s API credentials here and reference them from pipelines. Grant your ADF’s identity access to read secrets from this vault (using an access policy or Azure RBAC).

OneLake (Fabric) Setup: Microsoft Fabric’s OneLake is a SaaS data lake that comes enabled by default in your tenant
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. There is no Azure resource to create for OneLake – instead, you will create Fabric workspaces and Lakehouse items in later steps to utilize OneLake. Prerequisite: Make sure your tenant has Fabric enabled (either a Fabric capacity or trial) and that you have permissions to create Fabric workspaces. OneLake is automatically available and stores all Fabric data in Delta Parquet format by default
learn.microsoft.com
, which we will leverage for Delta storage.

Service Principal for Fabric Access: Create an Azure AD application (service principal) that ADF can use to access Fabric. Register a new app in Azure AD and generate a client secret. Record the Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret. In the Fabric (Power BI) admin portal, enable service principal access to Fabric if not already enabled
learn.microsoft.com
. Add this service principal as a Contributor (or Member/Admin) to the Fabric workspace(s) that will contain the OneLake Lakehouse
learn.microsoft.com
 – this grants it rights to read/write data in OneLake via ADF. Store the client secret in Key Vault for security.

By the end of this step, you should have a resource group containing a new ADF instance and Key Vault, and have a service principal ready for Fabric integration. These form the foundation for all further automation.

2. Bootstrapping a New GitHub Repository from Templates

Set up a fresh GitHub repository for the new client’s code, using a predefined template to ensure consistent structure. This can be automated so that running a script will create the repo and populate it with boilerplate files:

Template Repository: Prepare a template repo (or use an existing one) that contains the standardized directory structure, pipeline JSON templates, PowerShell scripts, GitHub Actions workflows, etc., needed for onboarding. Mark this repo as a template on GitHub.

Automated Repo Creation: Use GitHub’s REST API or CLI to create a new repository from the template. The GitHub API provides a /generate endpoint to spawn a repo from a template in one call
stackoverflow.com
. For example, a script can send a POST request to https://api.github.com/repos/<TEMPLATE_OWNER>/<TEMPLATE_REPO>/generate with JSON body specifying the new repo name, owner org, description, etc. This automatically copies all files from the template into the new repo
stackoverflow.com
. You can invoke this via PowerShell using Invoke-RestMethod with a Personal Access Token, or use the GitHub CLI (gh repo create --template <templateRepo>).

Repo Initialization: Once created, the repo will contain the template files (ADF pipeline JSON, configuration files, deployment scripts, etc.). If needed, the automation script can also programmatically initialize Git (git init, add remote) and push the template contents. However, using the template API as above usually includes all files already. Ensure the repo has appropriate branching (for example, a main or develop branch) per your source control strategy.

By automating this bootstrapping, onboarding a new client starts with a source-controlled repo pre-loaded with all necessary templates and scripts, providing a consistent starting point for CI/CD.

3. Creating Parameterized ADF Pipeline Templates

Design your Data Factory pipelines as templates that can be easily customized per client without rewriting logic. Use parameterization in ADF to handle client-specific differences:

Pipeline Parameters: In the ADF pipeline JSON, define parameters for any values that vary by client. For example, parameters for the client’s API base URL, API keys/credentials, dataset names, OneLake output folder path, etc. This allows the same pipeline definition to be reused with different inputs. ADF allows passing external values into pipelines, datasets, linked services, and data flows via parameters
learn.microsoft.com
.

Datasets and Linked Services: Also parameterize linked services (e.g. the HTTP connection for the client API) and datasets (for OneLake storage paths). For instance, the linked service for the REST API can have a parameterized base URL or authentication, and the sink dataset for OneLake can take the client’s target folder as a parameter. This way, you avoid hard-coding any client-specific endpoints or resource IDs in the JSON.

ARM Template Parameterization: When you publish ADF to source control, Azure Data Factory typically generates an ARM template (ARMTemplate.json) and a parameters file (ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json). Many properties get parameterized by default (like linked service connection strings marked as secure). For any properties not auto-parameterized that need to vary (e.g. Key Vault secret names or resource IDs), you can use ADF’s custom ARM parameter configuration to force them into the parameters file
learn.microsoft.com
. In Azure Data Factory’s Git mode, you can edit the arm-template-parameters-definition.json to add custom parameterization rules, ensuring your ARM template is fully configurable for each deployment environment
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
.

Re-usable JSON Templates: Store the JSON definitions (pipelines, datasets, linkedServices) in the repository (usually under a folder like ADF\ if using ADF code integration). These act as the master templates. The idea is that when onboarding a client, you can either deploy these as-is with parameters or do a find-and-replace for placeholders (e.g., replace "clientName": "<CLIENT_NAME>" with the actual client’s name) in a copy of the JSON. In practice, using ARM deployment with a parameter file is more robust than string replacement – you’ll supply the client-specific values at deployment time.

By parameterizing your ADF JSON templates, you ensure that bringing on a new client only requires supplying a set of parameters (client name, URLs, etc.) rather than duplicating and editing pipeline logic. This is key to scaling the solution.

4. Managing API Credentials in Azure Key Vault

Securely handle any sensitive credentials (like API keys, tokens, or passwords for the client’s source systems) by using Azure Key Vault:

Store Secrets: In the Key Vault created earlier, add secrets for the client’s API access. For example, you might store a secret for the client’s API key, labeled ClientA-ApiKey, and perhaps the base URL or other credentials if needed. Also store the Fabric service principal secret here (e.g., Fabric-SP-Secret) so that pipelines can retrieve it when connecting to OneLake.

Key Vault Integration in ADF: Configure ADF linked services to use those Key Vault secrets. Azure Data Factory supports referencing Azure Key Vault secrets in linked service definitions for secure strings
learn.microsoft.com
. For instance, if you have an HTTP linked service for the client’s API, instead of embedding the API key in the header within the JSON, use a Key Vault reference (ADF’s linked service JSON allows a reference like "secureString": "@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=<vaultSecretURI>)"). ADF’s default ARM template generation will parameterize secure strings and Key Vault references automatically
learn.microsoft.com
.

Permissions: Ensure the ADF’s managed identity (or the service principal being used by ADF if specified) has Get access to the Key Vault secrets. You can set an access policy on the Key Vault for the Data Factory’s managed identity or use RBAC (Key Vault Secrets User role) so that ADF can retrieve secrets at runtime. This avoids storing any sensitive info in code or config files.

Referencing in Pipelines: In your pipeline activities or datasets, reference the linked service’s secure parameters. For example, an HTTP dataset might use @{linkedService().ApiKey} which pulls from Key Vault at execution time. For the OneLake linked service (Fabric Lakehouse connector), the service principal client secret can also be stored in Key Vault and referenced as a secureString
learn.microsoft.com
. This keeps all credentials out of your GitHub repo and in a secure vault.

By using Key Vault, each new client’s secrets are centrally managed and protected. The onboarding script can automatically create the necessary Key Vault entries (e.g., using Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to set secret values) as part of the setup.

5. PowerShell Automation Script for Setup Tasks

Develop a PowerShell script (or set of scripts) that ties together the provisioning and configuration steps. The goal is that running one or two commands performs all needed setup for a new client. Key functions of the script include:

OneLake Folder (Lakehouse) Creation: Automate creating a storage location in OneLake for the client’s data. In Fabric, OneLake storage is organized by workspace and item
learn.microsoft.com
. The script should create a Lakehouse item in the client’s Dev Fabric workspace (and optionally in Test/Prod workspaces if needed). You can use the Fabric REST API to create a Lakehouse programmatically. For example, calling POST https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/lakehouses with a JSON body specifying the Lakehouse name will provision a new Lakehouse in that workspace
learn.microsoft.com
. (Ensure the service principal has permission to create items in that workspace.) This Lakehouse corresponds to a OneLake folder behind the scenes. Alternatively, you could create a folder via ADLS Gen2 API: OneLake can be accessed with ADLS Gen2 endpoints, treating the workspace as a container and the lakehouse as a folder
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. However, using the Fabric API to create the Lakehouse is more straightforward for provisioning. The script should capture the new Lakehouse’s IDs (workspace ID and item ID) for use in pipeline configurations.

Pipeline Parameter Injection: The script should take the base pipeline JSON templates (from step 3) and inject client-specific parameters into them (if not using ARM deployment method). For instance, it can replace placeholders or update the parameter JSON file with the actual Key Vault name, secret names, API URLs, Lakehouse workspace/item IDs, etc. PowerShell’s JSON cmdlets (ConvertFrom-Json / ConvertTo-Json) or simple text replace can be used to modify the template files. If using the ARM template approach, you would instead prepare an ARM parameters JSON on the fly populated with values for this client.

GitHub Repo Initialization: Integrate the script with the repo bootstrapping (step 2). If not already created by an earlier step, the script can call GitHub’s API to create the repo from the template
stackoverflow.com
. After creation, use Git commands or GitHub API to push the updated pipeline JSON (with injected parameters) and any configuration changes into the repository. For example, the script might:

Clone the newly created repo locally,

Copy in the modified pipeline templates (now customized for the client),

Commit and push these changes.
This ensures the repo reflects the client’s configuration. If using a pure ARM template deployment, the repo might not need per-client modifications, and you can use the same templates for all clients – in that case, ensure the pipeline knows to use the correct parameters for the client (perhaps by naming convention or a parameters file in the repo).

General Automation Flow: The PowerShell script will likely orchestrate all preceding steps: Azure resource creation (via Az PowerShell modules), Key Vault secret creation, calling Fabric REST APIs (for workspace/item creation), and interacting with GitHub. It’s advisable to use modular functions within it (e.g., a function New-ClientInfrastructure for Azure stuff, New-ClientFabricSetup for Fabric workspace/lakehouse, New-ClientRepo for GitHub, etc.). Include error handling and verbose logging in the script so that any failures during provisioning are clearly reported (more on logging in step 10).

With such a script, onboarding is simplified to running: .\Onboard-Client.ps1 -ClientName "Contoso" (and perhaps passing parameters like subscription, GitHub org name, etc.), and the script carries out the entire setup end-to-end.

6. Configuring GitHub Actions for CI/CD Deployments

Set up GitHub Actions workflows in the new repo to automate continuous integration and deployment for both the data pipelines and the Power BI reports:

CI/CD for Azure Data Factory: Use a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the ADF assets (pipelines, datasets, linked services) to the client’s Data Factory. One approach is to use the official Azure Data Factory Deploy action from the GitHub Marketplace
techcommunity.microsoft.com
. This action (or a custom script) can deploy ADF JSON resources via ARM template. Typically, the process involves two jobs:

Build/Validation job: This job runs on commits to the repo. It can use the @microsoft/azure-data-factory-utilities npm package to validate all pipeline JSON files and generate an ARM template artifact for deployment
techcommunity.microsoft.com
. (ADF’s Git integration can generate an ARM template of the factory – the utility helps automate this.) Validating early catches any JSON syntax or configuration errors.

Deployment job: This job takes the ARM template (and parameter file) and deploys it to the Azure Data Factory instance. You can use the Azure CLI or Az PowerShell in the workflow to do this (e.g., az deployment group create --resource-group <rg> --template-file ARMTemplate.json --parameters ARMParameters.json). The Data Factory Deploy action encapsulates this logic, including running any pre/post deployment PowerShell scripts provided by Microsoft
techcommunity.microsoft.com
. The GitHub Actions YAML should be configured with Azure credentials – the recommended approach is to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation with Azure. For example, create a federated credential for a Managed Identity in Azure AD as described by Microsoft
techcommunity.microsoft.com
techcommunity.microsoft.com
, and use the azure/login action in GitHub to authenticate without storing secrets. Once authenticated, the workflow can deploy to Azure securely.

CI/CD for Power BI (Fabric) Assets: Automating Power BI content deployment involves using the Power BI REST APIs or available actions:

Publish Reports/Datasets: If you have Power BI report (.pbix) files in the repo (for the client’s reports), the workflow can use the Power BI REST API to import these into the Fabric workspace. There are community GitHub Actions such as Power BI Service Upload that can upload a PBIX to a workspace
github.com
. Alternatively, you can call the REST API directly in a script step: use the Import API to publish the PBIX to the client’s Dev workspace (this creates or updates a dataset and report in Fabric). This requires an AAD token with appropriate Power BI scopes, which you can obtain using a service principal (store the SP ID and secret as GitHub secrets and call an Azure AD auth endpoint in the script).

Deployment Pipeline Promotion: Since we set up deployment pipelines in Fabric (in the next step), you have two choices for promoting content to Test and Prod:

Via Fabric Deployment Pipelines API: Leverage the Power BI REST deployment pipeline APIs to deploy content from Dev workspace to Test, and Test to Prod. You can call the Deploy API (either “deploy all” or selective deploy) to push the new or updated content to the next stage
learn.microsoft.com
. For example, after importing a dataset/report into Dev, call the pipeline API to deploy all to Test, and again to Prod. These calls can be scripted in PowerShell using Invoke-PowerBIRestMethod from the Power BI cmdlets. Microsoft’s documentation confirms that all pipeline operations (creating pipelines, assigning workspaces, deploying, etc.) can be done via REST, which can be integrated into GitHub Actions
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
.

Direct Upload to Each Workspace: Alternatively, skip using Fabric pipelines and treat each workspace separately in CI. The workflow could import the PBIX directly into Dev, Test, and Prod workspaces via API (for example, maintaining separate files or branches for different stages). However, using the deployment pipeline API is cleaner as it mirrors the typical development lifecycle and retains pipeline history.

GitHub Actions Secrets: Store necessary secrets in the repository’s Actions secrets (e.g., AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID for Azure login, and perhaps PBI_CLIENT_ID, PBI_CLIENT_SECRET for Power BI SPN). The workflows will reference these to authenticate. Using OIDC for Azure as mentioned can eliminate needing an Azure secret. For Power BI, currently a client secret is typically needed for non-interactive auth (ensure the service principal is enabled for Power BI API access and added to the workspaces with appropriate roles).

Trigger Conditions: Set the workflows to trigger on pushes or PRs to main branch. You might set up separate YAML pipelines: one for ADF (data pipeline) deployment and one for Power BI. This separation allows, for example, the ADF pipeline to run on pipeline JSON changes, and the Power BI pipeline to run when PBIX files or related config change.

With GitHub Actions configured, any update to the pipelines or reports in source control will automatically get deployed to the cloud, making your demo environment truly CI/CD-enabled. This ensures that after the one-time onboarding script, ongoing changes for that client can be managed through Git (which is especially useful if you refine the templates or add features).

7. Provisioning and Linking Fabric Workspaces (Dev/Test/Prod)

Next, set up the Microsoft Fabric environment for the client’s BI content with a Dev, Test, and Prod workspace and connect them via a deployment pipeline:

Create Fabric Workspaces: Use the Power BI REST API to create three new workspaces for the client – for example, "ClientX Dev", "ClientX Test", "ClientX Prod". The API endpoint POST https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups creates a workspace (also called a “group”)
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. Make sure the service principal or user you use has permission to create workspaces (Fabric admin may need to enable service principal workspace creation
learn.microsoft.com
). Include the parameter ?workspaceV2=true in the API call if needed to create a new Fabric workspace (V2)
learn.microsoft.com
. The script should capture the Workspace IDs of these new workspaces.

Create Deployment Pipeline: Using the Power BI REST API or Power BI PowerShell, create a new deployment pipeline for this client. There’s an API for Create Pipeline that returns a Pipeline ID
learn.microsoft.com
. Give it a name like "ClientX Release Pipeline".

Assign Workspaces to Pipeline Stages: With the pipeline created, assign the Dev workspace to the pipeline’s Development stage, Test workspace to the Test stage, and Prod to Prod stage. The API AssignWorkspace allows binding a workspace ID to a given stage of a pipeline
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. After this, the pipeline in the Fabric portal will show the three stages linked to the client’s workspaces.

Verify in Fabric UI: (If desired, you can verify at this point via the Fabric web portal that the pipeline and workspaces are set up correctly – you should see a deployment pipeline with Dev/Test/Prod for the client. All staging is empty initially.)

Workspace Isolation: Each client’s workspaces are separate from others, fulfilling the isolation requirement. No data or content is shared across clients because each has their own set of Fabric workspaces and pipeline. This also means you can manage access per client (addressed in step 9).

Connecting ADF to Fabric Workspaces: Recall from step 1 that you granted the ADF’s service principal access to the Fabric workspaces. The ADF linked service for OneLake will use the workspace’s GUID and the lakehouse item GUID. For the Dev workspace, use its GUID in the linked service configuration (property workspaceId and the Lakehouse artifactId in the JSON
learn.microsoft.com
). This ties the ADF pipeline to the specific Lakehouse in the client’s Dev workspace. When promoting to Test/Prod, you could either re-point the pipelines to the new workspace IDs or, more elegantly, use Fabric’s deployment pipeline to move data artifacts – see next section about data connection.

By automating workspace and pipeline creation, the environment for report deployment is ready as part of onboarding. The new client now has an isolated Dev/Test/Prod Fabric setup wired into a deployment pipeline, ready to receive content from CI/CD.

8. Connecting Power BI Reports to OneLake Data

Ensure that the Power BI reports (datasets) for the client are configured to retrieve data from the correct OneLake location (the Delta files in the client’s Lakehouse):

Data Source Binding: If your Power BI dataset was originally developed pointing to a certain path (e.g., a Lakehouse or ADLS path), you need to update it to the client’s specific OneLake path. One approach is to include a parameter in the Power BI report (e.g., a parameter for “DataLakePath” or “ClientName”) and have your Power Query use that parameter in the source step. Then, for each client’s deployment, you can update that parameter to the client’s OneLake folder. The Power BI REST API has endpoints to update parameters of a dataset or data source settings. For instance, after importing the PBIX to the Dev workspace, you could call the Update Datasources API or use Set-PowerBIDataSource cmdlet to point it to the correct OneLake URL/path for the client’s Lakehouse.

Fabric Deployment Pipeline Rules: If you’re using the Fabric deployment pipeline for Dev->Test->Prod, you can take advantage of deployment rules for parameters or data sources. In the pipeline UI or via API, define a rule such that in Test and Prod stages, the dataset’s data source is mapped to the Test/Prod Lakehouse (if they are different) or perhaps to a read-only copy of the data. For example, if Dev Lakehouse is getting fresh data, you might have Test/Prod use a snapshot or the same data – this depends on how you want to flow data. If each workspace has its own Lakehouse (and the ingestion pipeline also runs per environment), then set rules so that when content is deployed, the dataset automatically relinks to the Lakehouse in the current stage’s workspace. This can be configured by matching the data source connection by name and swapping the workspace ID.

OneLake Path Format: The OneLake (Fabric) connector in Power BI can access the Lakehouse files directly (via Direct Lake or import through Spark). Under the hood, the connection might use the OneLake URL. OneLake uses ADLS Gen2 APIs, so the path could look like: abfss://<workspaceName>@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/<lakehouseName>.lakehouse/Files/<path>
learn.microsoft.com
learn.microsoft.com
. Ensure the dataset’s data source or queries use the correct workspace and lakehouse name (or GUIDs). If using Spark or Data Warehouse as an intermediate, adjust accordingly. For simplicity, many demos use the Lakehouse’s built-in capability to expose tables to Power BI directly (Direct Lake mode), in which case you ensure the Power BI dataset is built on the client’s Lakehouse table.

Automated Data Source Update: As part of the CI/CD pipeline (step 6), include a step post-PBIX deployment to update the data source. Microsoft’s documentation notes that you can script operations like importing a PBIX and then updating its data connections via REST
learn.microsoft.com
. For example, use the Bind To Gateway (if a gateway is needed for on-prem, not in this case) or Update Datasource API to swap out the connection string to the client’s OneLake path. This could also be done with a Power BI PowerShell cmdlet Set-PowerBIDataset or using the Power BI .NET SDK as part of a script.

Testing the Connection: After deployment, it’s good practice to run a dataset refresh (via API) in the Dev workspace to ensure it can pull the client’s data from OneLake. If using DirectQuery/Direct Lake, validate that the visuals in Power BI can query the delta files. Adjust any firewall or authentication issues (the service principal might need to be a Fabric workspace admin or member to read the data).

In summary, the Power BI reports for the client will be wired to their data in OneLake. Thanks to parameterization and deployment rules, this can be achieved without manual editing of PBIX files for each client/environment – the process can update connections automatically using APIs
learn.microsoft.com
.

9. Securing Access with Azure AD and Roles

With all resources provisioned, it’s crucial to secure them so that only authorized people (or services) can access each client’s environment:

Azure AD Groups for Client Access: Create Azure AD security groups to represent roles for the client’s workspaces. For example, you might have a group for the client’s analysts or report viewers, and another for internal developers. Add the appropriate user identities to these groups. Using groups simplifies managing permissions (you won’t have to edit workspace access every time a person changes).

Assign Workspace Roles: Use the Power BI REST API to add these groups or users to the Fabric workspaces. The Add Group User API allows granting a principal (user or group) a given access right (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer) on a workspace
learn.microsoft.com
. For instance, call the API for each workspace ID: assign your internal Power BI developers as Admins or Members in the Dev workspace, and possibly the client’s user group as Viewers in the Prod workspace (if they are to consume reports via the app). This can be automated in the onboarding script. In the request body, you specify the Azure AD object ID and the role (e.g., "groupUserAccessRight": "Admin")
learn.microsoft.com
.

Secure Key Vault and Azure Resources: The Key Vault should only allow the relevant ADF instance and perhaps a limited set of administrators to access secrets. This was configured in step 4, but double-check access policies. The ADF itself can be locked down such that only specific users or an AD group of data engineers have contributor access to it (via Azure RBAC on the resource group or factory).

Isolation Between Clients: Because each client has separate Azure resources and separate Fabric workspaces, they are naturally isolated. Still, apply naming conventions and possibly Azure Policy to ensure one client’s resources can’t accidentally reference another’s. For example, you might use a naming prefix for all resources of a client (ClientX-DataFactory, ClientX-KeyVault, etc.). This also helps with role assignments.

Service Principal Permissions: The service principal used by the automation should have minimal required permissions. It will need roles in Azure (perhaps Contributor on the resource group to create resources, or specific roles like Data Factory contributor) and in Fabric (as we set, a Contributor on Fabric workspaces, plus the ability to create workspaces if using it for that). Follow the principle of least privilege. For instance, you might have one Azure AD application that is allowed to automate setup across all clients, but it only has access where needed.

Validation of Access: After setup, it’s wise to validate that:

ADF pipelines can indeed run and pull from the API and write to OneLake (the service principal has access to the Lakehouse).

Power BI reports can be viewed by the intended users and not by others.

The client’s data in OneLake isn’t accessible to other clients’ principals. (OneLake uses Fabric’s security model: only workspace members can access that workspace’s data
learn.microsoft.com
, so by limiting workspace membership to the right people/service accounts, you prevent cross-client access.)

Security configuration can also be baked into the PowerShell script. For example, after creating workspaces, the script can call the Add User API for each necessary principal. This ensures that right after onboarding, the client’s team (and your team) can access what they need, and nothing more.

10. Additional Enhancements and Best Practices

Finally, consider implementing the following features to make the solution more robust and enterprise-ready:

Robust Error Handling & Retry: Build retry logic into data ingestion. Azure Data Factory’s activities have a built-in retryCount and retryInterval you can set for transient errors (e.g., if the client API call fails, automatically retry 3 times). You could also incorporate error handling activities (ADF supports try/catch via pipeline flow controls). Ensure the GitHub Action workflows are set to fail on errors and perhaps use job conditions to perform cleanup or notifications on failure.

Logging and Monitoring: Enable logging for troubleshooting and audit. In ADF, turn on Diagnostic Settings to send pipeline run logs to Log Analytics or Azure Monitor. This way you can track successes/failures of monthly pipeline runs and even query them. For the PowerShell setup script, output key steps to a log file. In Power BI, usage metrics are available; consider using the Power BI admin APIs to audit deployments and data refreshes. You might also set up alerts – e.g., Azure Monitor alert if a pipeline run fails, or a GitHub Actions status badge to monitor workflow runs.

Governance and Metadata: Integrate with governance tools if available. Microsoft Purview (Azure Purview) can scan Azure Data Factories, ADLS (OneLake appears as ADLS Gen2), and Power BI datasets for lineage. Setting up Purview (or Fabric’s built-in lineage view) can help you and the client see data lineage from the API source through the lakehouse to the report. Tag Azure resources with client identifiers and environment (Dev/Test/Prod) for cost tracking and clarity. Use Azure Policy to enforce tagging and perhaps prevent resource creation outside the provisioning script.

OneLake Data Governance: Since OneLake is multi-tenant (one per Fabric tenant), consider using Fabric’s Shortcuts if you need to share common data across workspaces. In this demo, probably not needed, but it’s good to note that if some reference data is global, OneLake shortcuts could be used instead of copying data.

Consistency and Idempotency: Make the PowerShell script idempotent where possible. If you run it twice for the same client, it should ideally detect existing resources and not fail or duplicate. This could involve checking if the resource group or workspace exists, etc. It might output a warning or skip creation if things are already set up.

Testing the Onboarding: Create a test client or use a non-production subscription to run the entire automation as a dry run. This will help validate that all permissions are correct and steps are executed in the right order. For instance, verify that after running the script, you can simply go to the Dev workspace, open the deployed Power BI report, and see data from the client’s API (assuming sample data was pulled).

Documentation and Templates: Maintain documentation or a runbook within the repo template so that if someone needs to onboard a client manually or maintain the scripts, they understand the process. Include README files about how the CI/CD is structured (for example, how to update a pipeline template and propagate to clients if needed).

Cleanup and Rollback: Although not typically part of onboarding, consider how you’d remove a client if needed. Perhaps scripts to deactivate or delete resources, or at least a script to remove all resources created for a client (be careful with data deletion though). This is part of governance to not leave unused resources (and incurring cost).

By incorporating these practices, your one-click (or one-command) onboarding demo will not only deploy the solution end-to-end, but do so reliably, securely, and with maintainability in mind. After executing these steps, onboarding a new client should be as simple as running the automation and then handing the client their working Power BI app populated with their data – a huge win for efficiency in a multi-client environment.
