## Four pillars of continuous Intergration

Version Control system > Package Management system > Continuous Intergration system > Automated build process

| Continuous Integration | Continuous Delivery |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Increase code coverage | Automatically deploy code to production |
| Build faster by splitting test and build runs | Ensure deployment targets have the latest code |
| Automatically ensure you dont ship broken code | Use tested code from the CI process |
