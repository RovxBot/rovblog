- Get Determinate for WSL

```powershell
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install --determinate
```wsl

- cd to Git repo

```bash
cd /mnt/d/Git/homelab

  vars:
    control_plane_endpoint: 192.168.1.180
    load_balancer_ip_pool:
      - 10.0.0.0/24

      hosts:
        metal0: {ansible_host: 192.168.1.190, mac: 'D8:9E:F3:90:E8:31', disk: nvme0n1, network_interface: enp0s31f6}
        metal1: {ansible_host: 192.168.1.191, mac: 'D8:9E:F3:10:E8:A8', disk: nvme0n1, network_interface: enp0s31f6}
    workers:
      hosts:
```

- Terraform
    - Added teraform workspace as terraform ID: ws-yM6CtwT9NWtgTug3
    - Im unsure if this is what was required, but we will see I guess.

- git commit and push!
- Homelab token for github: 

You need to use a token for login for CLI. Using your github username and password will not work.

## Conclusion

Well thats it for tonight. Im going to grab the mini PCs tomorrow night and wipe them.
I will need to set the Bios to wake on lan, collect the real mac addresses, and collect the network interfaces.

I should have the second lot of power supplies comming soon, so I will also need to add the other two mini PCs to the config.
